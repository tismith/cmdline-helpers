This is a collection of small utilities to help out with programs
that need to run shell commands.

Started as a test rewrite of some utilites from a connection manager daemon
but it exists on it's own now.

They're desiged to be able to cascade with other commands. 

E.g.

expect-return 1 sh -c "return 1"

Will have a 'successful' return code of 0
